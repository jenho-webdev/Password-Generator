This password generator web app can be a powerful tool that helps users generate strong and unique passwords quickly and easily. The app feature a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to input their desired password length. It also give the user options on select which types of character that they want to use to generate their new password.

To ensure maximum security, the password generator web app validate the user's requested password length to be in the range of 8 characters long to 128 characters which are difficult for hackers to guess or brute-force. 

The Password Generator app is still in its early stages of development and we released it now as a functional and user friendly password generator, but we planned to add more features to it in the feautre releases. Please see the "Road Map" section of this README document for more features that we planned to add to the app.
